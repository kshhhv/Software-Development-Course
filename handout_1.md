# Codes that I depend on

## Spiceypy: 
Python wrapper of c_spice

## Vicar.py: 
Written by DLR/KDM to load data in readable format



# Written by me

## HRSC intercept

A bunch of functions that:
- uses spice kernels of Mars Express/HRSC to trace out vectors from the camera pixels
- find the intercept point of the vectors on Phobos surface
- calculate viewing angles, distance to the sun/sc, etc.


## Image co-registration

Affine transformation (in matlab):
- Manual control point selection
- Calculates best affine transformation !

Translation (in python):
- Opens the two images overlayed
- Manual shifting using cursor


## Photometry

- A bunch of photometry models to correct and analyse images/phase curves.
- Some fitting plotting functions
- Some functions to generate map from the data
